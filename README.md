Identify certain users by certain characteristics


Instructions: [Install Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) then click 'Install this script' [on this page](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/152005-trumpy2017). The user list is compiled of 18000 people who have submitted to /r/the_donald or earned more than 100 comment karma there in 2016.

I think it should work for you but tell me if it doesn't. I would like to make it a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome to be easier to use, but I don't how, so someone else is welcome to try. Also it does not check usernames loaded by Neverending Reddit or 'show more comments'. 

Some people have posted about being careful of running this code on your computer. All it does is:

1. on reddit.com pages,
2. get all usernames and check against the master list
3. if the username is on the master list, put the icon next to it

No data gets sent anywhere. Code is right there to inspect.
